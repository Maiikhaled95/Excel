Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Data Visualization Projects through Macquarie Excel Skills for Data Analytics and Visualization Specialization.

The first project is **ZenCo Network Equipment Inventory**.The inventory sheet shows how many of each item we have in stock and how much they cost.				
When stock level falls below the minimum, we need to re-order. Sometimes the supplier does not have stock and so we indicate it is on backorder, items already on backorder to not need to be ordered again using different Logical(**IF**, **Nested IF**) and Lookup Functions(**Vlookup**, **Xlookup**, **Index**, **Match**) and combining logical and look up functions together in one function.
Building ZenCo quote after checking the stock and which needs to re-order.

The second project is building **ZenCo HR Database** through **Data Cleaning**, using **Excel Text Functions** (Concat/Concatenate/right/mid/left/find/len/proper/lower/upper/substitute), and checking if there's any duplicates using **Conditional Formatting**.
